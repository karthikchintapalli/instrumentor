Not an investment heavy platform

Kinds of feedback: when scalable: 100 people missed this chord!, Pointing out fine flaws and important points. 
Some kinds of chord progressions might be hard. 
Real life inferences wrt guitar. Better than tutor as we have  more statistics, breadth. 

Good proposition in terms of target segment, 
Musical meet ups -- in the future - form a band etc.
As you move from beginner to intermediate stage -- sell their data to organizations looking for such instrument players
Leverage power of platform to elevate the players.

Differentiating factor: ***software for note generation***, automatic evaluation, 
So use that as the key! USP

Less dependent on complementors, substitutors
Less dependent on market
We don't have to worry about a lot of things,

Go to market strategy

Paradoxical situation

How to make outreach

If you target teachers, they wont endorse if you have tutorials on it.

Option 1: Learning tool for all students, teachers, youtube learners. For self-assessment & benchmarking, + gamification! 
Then get enough scale. Not much variable cost. Don't have to market it much. Free tool? Start off

Free forever for a small set of features
Charge for additional features.
Gamification is very important
Free should be good enough that people use it a lot
Premium for people who use it more advanced
Freemium model
Once you get scale, data, insights, you can have your own classes, training path
Checkout eatfit
Easy targeting: all youtube videos where they teach instrument, all online course, integrate withone of these courses, all classes
Teachers need to pay to you: they earn from it
VERY valuable to teachers especially in non-indian context.
Never a one-to-one session.
Make it more scalable for these teachers & classes also. Directly start pricing them.
Backward integrate into classes 
Cool prototype: What would be the free features, what would be the paid features! FREEMIUM model is the MODEL!
What is enough to be free but not too much to get comfortable
Subscription based

Option 2: 
Instrumental songs only - keyboard only
Classes integrated platform
Students' perspective
Risk: not as personalized 
For India or for the entire world? India will probably work better
Internet adoption wrt how data connectivity is in different regions
Data penetration
Tier 2,3 economically
Ad targeting, which instructors? 
Locality in instructors; Infact, this app can help you find a tutor in your area. Communication based.
India only segment
Age demography: 15 - 35
Segment without targeting: 15 - 35, 35 - 50, 50 +
Geographies: Tier 1,2,3 cities

Targeting: 15 - 35 age group, tier one cities, one-stop platform to learn an instrument with a community at a beginner levl 
and reach a good level

Competitors: Classes, youtube videos, home tutors, online courses

Differentiator: YOU PICK THE SONGS OR GENRE YOU WANT
It's okay to have multiple different differentiators per competitor

Go to market strategy: Put out ads, tie up with instrument selling stores, youtube videos tutorials, sponsor their videos. 
PUT SOME VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE!!!! Start with wide range of songs to capture the breadth of music across genres. 
First 2 classes of every course can go free
Use youtube, facebook
Social media marketing if you have money.
Targeting on social media is crazy!

Build app specific to that 


Gamification + creating community around leaderboards + core play scoring technology using sheet generation & automated evaluation 
= Very valuable
